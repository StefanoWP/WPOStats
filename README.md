# WPOStats

Performance can have a dramatic impact on important business metrics online, as study after study has showed. The goal of [WPO Stats](http://wpostats.com) is to become a repository of those studies so that people can find the studies most relevant to their own situation.

## Contributing
To make sure WPO Stats never goes stale and instead becomes a comprehensive resource, anyone can add additional studies by filing an issue on GitHub. See how that works in the [Contributing guide](https://github.com/tkadlec/WPOStats/tree/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
