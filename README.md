# WPOStats

Performance can have a dramatic impact on important business metrics online, as study after study has showed. The goal of [WPO Stats](http://wpostats.com) is to become a repository of those studies so that people can find the studies most relavant to their own situation.

## Contributing
To make sure WPO Stats never goes stale and instead becomes a comprehensive resouce, anyone can add additional studies by filing an issue on GitHub. More detailed instructions are available in the [contribute folder](https://github.com/tkadlec/WPOStats/tree/master/contribute).
