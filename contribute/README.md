# How to Contribute

To make sure WPO Stats never goes stale and becomes a comprehensive resouce, anyone can add additional studies using GitHub. We'd like to avoid making everyone go through the process of cloning the repo locally, so here's the easiest way to get a new case study onto the site:

1. File an issue on the project using the template found here: [https://github.com/tkadlec/WPOStats/blob/master/contribute/study-template.txt](https://github.com/tkadlec/WPOStats/blob/master/contribute/study-template.txt). Apply the "study" label to the issue.
2. Wait for us to take the issue and add it to the list of studies.
3. Celebrate in the way you choose fit (preferrably with cake involved).
